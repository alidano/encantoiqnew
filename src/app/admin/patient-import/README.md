# DELETED - Patient Import functionality has been replaced by automatic BioTrack synchronization

This directory has been removed because:
- Patient import is no longer needed
- Patients are now automatically synchronized from BioTrack customers
- Only customers with licenses expiring in the next 6 months are synced
- Data is always up-to-date

## Migration completed on August 4, 2025

- ✅ Migrated from `patients` table to `customers` table
- ✅ Automatic sync from BioTrack  
- ✅ Real dispensary names from `locations` table
- ✅ Removed manual import functionality
